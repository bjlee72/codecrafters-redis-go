This is my implementation of the 
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Instructioins

Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.

1. Ensure you have `go (1.19)` installed locally
1. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `app/server.go`.
